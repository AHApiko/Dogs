# Dogs Breed Classifier
The primary objective of this project is to develop a dog breed classifier using Xception. After initially trying a simple CNN and also exploring RestGen, I found that Xception gave the best results.

Due to computational reasons, I opted to use Google Colab.

After building the model, I decided to do a web page application to make it more interactive,. In this application, users can upload a picture of a dog and receive the breed prediction generated by the model. To achieve this, I saved the model and created a "templates" folder, in the same directory where I stored my scripts, containing the index and result files in .txt format. Finally, I executed the application script using Flask.
