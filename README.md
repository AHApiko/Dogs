# Dogs Breed Classifier
First of all, I would like to mention that I'm still a beginner and the primary motivation behind creating this project, and basically all the project I do, is to improve my skills and keep learning, in this case I wanted to practice DL and TensorFlow by using an image classification, so don't hesitate to correct it or give me some feedback, it would be much appreciated.

I developed a dog breed classifier using Xception. After initially trying a simple CNN and also exploring RestGen, I found that Xception gave the best results.

Due to computational reasons, I opted to use Google Colab.

After building the model, I decided to do a web page application to make it more interactive,. In this application, users can upload a picture of a dog and receive the breed prediction generated by the model. To achieve this, I saved the model and created a "templates" folder, in the same directory where I stored my scripts, containing the index and result files in .txt format. Finally, I executed the application script using Flask.
